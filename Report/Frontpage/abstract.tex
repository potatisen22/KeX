The core of this project focuses on how to make
aerial vehicles fly autonomously from an initial position to a
goal. This is done by making a mathematical model for the UAV,
a brief study of the sensors needed to estimate the UAVs state,
then designing an LQR controller for the trajectory tracking
and finally using an artificial potential field function for the
navigation. The mathematical model is done by studying the
kinematics and dynamics for a single UAV, it is then linearised
and the systemâ€™s observability and controllability are checked to
develop the LQR. We conduct computer simulations to test the
theoretical findings and evaluate the proposed methods. Finally,
we conclude the paper with the discussion and the results, and
provide directions and ideas to do further research on the topic.
