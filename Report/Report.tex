\title{Motion Control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle}
\author{Vilhelm~Dinevik and Paula~Carb\'o}
% author names and IEEE memberships
% note positions of commas and nonbreaking spaces ( ~ ) LaTeX will not break
% a structure at a ~ so this keeps an author's name from being broken across
% two lines.
% use \thanks{} to gain access to the first footnote area
% a separate \thanks must be used for each paragraph as LaTeX2e's \thanks
% was not built to handle multiple paragraphs
%



% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks -
% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name
% and the end of the author line. i.e., if you had this:
%
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
%
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
%
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
%
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
%
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{U}{nmanned} aerial vehicles, also known as UAVs, are becoming nowadays more and more popular because they are small, cheap to produce, have low operating and maintenance cost, have great maneuverability, can perform steady flight operations and are able to enter high-risk areas without having to compromise human safety. Most applications that involve UAVs have been used in open areas without any obstacles and with a human in control of the UAV. But in recent years people have come up with more modern applications of UAVs that will need UAVs to fly autonomously in densely populated areas, with a lot of other autonomous UAVs around, e.g. Amazon Prime Air delivery system, AltiGator drones services for inspection and data adquisition, or multi-UAVs used to deploy an aerial communications network. This places high demands on UAVsâ€™ obstacle avoidance capabilities for both moving and static obstacles.

 There are many different manufacturers and a vast amount of different UAV models, all with different motors, weights, sensors and lift-to-weight ratio. To make a standard autonomous flight applicable to all these kinds of UAVs, a simple and easy-to-implement multi-UAV mathematical model, that will still be able to avoid obstacles with as few sensors as possible, is needed.

This project aims to study and develop a mathematical model of a quadrotor UAV and the available sensors in it.  From the trajectory and pose tracking a state feedback controller will be designed. In order to facilitate the multi-UAV navigation, potential fields or an A* algorithm will be used to make several quads fly to their goals while maintaining collision avoidance with respect to other quads and obstacles. To check the validity of the models, a simulated test environment in MatLab filled with a random reasonable amount of static obstacles and autonomous UAVs will be used.

% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.

% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically

\section{Quadcopter modelling}
	\subsection{Overview}
		
		\begin{figure}
			\centering
			\input{graph/frames_propellers}
			\caption{Quadrotor with propellers and the two reference frames}
			\label{fig:frames_rotors}
		\end{figure}

	The UAV is a rigid body quadcopter, with a cross-shaped body and four electrical propellers. Front and rear rotors rotate in a clockwise direction, while right and left rotors do it in a counterclockwise direction, as we can see in \figurename \ref{fig:frames_rotors}. 
	\subsection{Notation}
	\subsection{Kinematics}
	To describe the motion of a 6 DOF rigid body, two right-hand reference frames can be defined: the Earth frame and the body frame, as we can see in \figurename \ref{fig:frames_rotors}. The Earth frame is static, with the $x_E$ axis pointing towards the North, the $y_E$ axis pointing towards the West, and $z_E$ pointing upwards w.r.t. the Earth. The body frame is attached to the body, with the $x_B$ axis pointing towards the quadrotor's front, the $y_B$ axis pointing towards the left, and the $z_B$ axis pointing upwards. In this case, the axis origin $o_B$ coincides with the quadrotor's structure center. 
	
	 \begin{equation} \label{eq:rotx}
	 	\bm{R}_x (\phi)=
	 	\left[ {\begin{array}{ccc}
	 		1 & 0 & 0 \\
	 		0 & \cos(\phi) & -\sin(\phi) \\
	 		0 &  \sin(\phi) & \cos(\phi) \\ 
	 		\end{array} } \right]
	 \end{equation}  

	
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:roty}
	\bm{R}_y (\theta)=
	\left[ {\begin{array}{ccc}
		\cos(\theta) & 0 & \sin(\theta) \\
		0 & 1 & 0 \\
		-\sin(\theta) &  0 & \cos(\theta) \\ 
		\end{array} } \right]
	 \end{equation}  
	
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:rotz}
	\bm{R}_z (\psi)=
	\left[ {\begin{array}{ccc}
		\cos(\psi) & -\sin(\psi) & 0 \\
		\sin(\psi) & \cos(\psi) & 0 \\
		0 &  0 & 1 \\ 
		\end{array} } \right]
	 \end{equation}  
	 
	Rotation matrix
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:rot}
		\bm{R}_\Theta (\phi, \theta, \psi) = 	\bm{R}_x (\phi)  \bm{R}_y (\theta)  \bm{R}_z (\psi)
	\end{equation}  
	
	Transfer matrix
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:transf}
		\bm{T}_\Theta (\phi,\theta )= \left[ {\begin{array}{ccc}
		1 & \sin(\phi) \cdot \tan(\theta) & \cos(\phi) \cdot \tan (\theta) \\
		0 & \cos(\phi) & -\sin(\phi) \\
		0 &  \sin(\phi)/\cos(\theta) & \cos(\phi)/\cos(\theta)  \\ 
		\end{array} } \right]
	\end{equation}  
	
	Generalized matrix
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:gen}
		\bm{J}_\Theta (\phi,\theta, \psi)= \left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
			\bm{R}_\Theta &  \mathbf{0}_{3\times 3} \\
			\mathbf{0}_{3\times 3} & \bm{T}_\Theta \\
			\end{array} } \right]
	\end{equation}  
	Where the notation $\mathbf{0}_{3\times 3}$ means a matrix filled with zeros with a $3 \times 3$ dimension.
	
	Generalized position: linear and angular position, in the Earth frame
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:pos}
		\bm{\xi} = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}
		\bm{x}^E & \bm{\eta}^E \\
		\end{array}\right]^T = \left[ \begin{array}{cccccc}
			x & y & z & \phi & \theta & \psi\\
		\end{array}\right] ^T
	\end{equation}  
	
	Generalized velocity: linear and angular velocity, in the body frame
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:vel}
		\bm{\nu} = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}
		\bm{v}^B & \bm{\omega}^B \\
		\end{array}\right]^T = \left[ \begin{array}{cccccc}
		u & v & w & p & q & r\\
		\end{array}\right] ^T 
	\end{equation}
	
	In order to relate the derivate of the generalized position in the Earth frame with the generalized velocity on the body frame there is the following equation:
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:derivpos_earth_body}
		\bm{\dot \xi} =  \bm{J}_\Theta \	\bm{\nu}
	\end{equation}
