	% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
	% by the rest of the first word in caps.
	%
	% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
	% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
	%
	% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by

	%
	% Some journals put the first two words in caps:

	% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter

	\IEEEPARstart{U}{nmanned} aerial vehicles, also known as UAVs, are becoming nowadays more and more popular because they are small, cheap to produce, have low operating and maintenance cost, have great maneuverability, can perform steady flight operations and are able to enter high-risk areas without having to compromise human safety. Most applications that involve UAVs have been used in open areas without any obstacles and with a human in control of the UAV. But in recent years people have come up with more modern applications of UAVs that will need UAVs to fly autonomously in densely populated areas, with a lot of other autonomous UAVs around, e.g. Amazon Prime Air delivery system, AltiGator drones services for inspection and data adquisition, or multi-UAVs used to deploy an aerial communications network. This places high demands on UAVsâ€™ obstacle avoidance capabilities for both moving and static obstacles.
	
	There are many different manufacturers and a vast amount of different UAV models, all with different motors, weights, sensors and lift-to-weight ratio. To make a standard autonomous flight applicable to all these kinds of UAVs, a simple and easy-to-implement multi-UAV mathematical model, that will still be able to avoid obstacles with as few sensors as possible, is needed.
	
	This project aims to study and develop a mathematical model of a quadrotor UAV and the available sensors in it.  From the trajectory and pose tracking a state feedback controller will be designed. In order to facilitate the multi-UAV navigation, potential fields or an A* algorithm will be used to make several quads fly to their goals while maintaining collision avoidance with respect to other quads and obstacles. To check the validity of the models, a simulated test environment in MatLab filled with a random reasonable amount of static obstacles and autonomous UAVs will be used.

	\section{Quadcopter modelling}
	\subsection{Overview}
	\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\input{graph/frames_propellers}
		\caption{Quadrotor with propellers and the two reference frames}
		\label{fig:frames_rotors}
	\end{figure}
	
	\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\input{graph/roll_pitch_yaw}
		\caption{Euler angles with respect to Earth frame.}
		\label{fig:roll_pitch_yaw}
	\end{figure}
	
	The UAV is a rigid body quadcopter, with a cross-shaped body and four electrical propellers. Front and rear rotors rotate in a clockwise direction, while right and left rotors do it in a counterclockwise direction, can be seen in \figurename \ref{fig:frames_rotors}. Its motion has 6 degrees of freedom and there are only 4 propellers, therefore the system is underactuated. 
	
	\subsection{Notation}
	
	\subsection{Kinematics}
	To describe the motion of the UAV without the forces and torques acting on it, a kinematic model for it will be developed.
	
	Two right-hand reference frames need to be defined: the Earth frame and the body frame, as can be seen in \figurename{\ref{fig:frames_rotors}}. 
	
	The Earth frame is static, with the $x_E$ axis pointing towards the North, the $y_E$ axis pointing towards the West, and $z_E$ pointing upwards w.r.t. the Earth. The body frame is attached to the UAV, with the $x_B$ axis pointing towards the quadrotor's front, the $y_B$ axis pointing towards the left, and the $z_B$ axis pointing upwards. In this case, the axis origin $o_B$ coincides with the quadrotor's structure center.
	
	The generalized position $\bm{\xi}$ contains the linear and angular position and it is described in the Earth frame, as in (\ref{eq:pos}). The linear position $\bm{x}^E$ of the UAV is the vector between the origin of the Earth frame $o_E$ and the origin of the body frame $o_B$, and the Euler angles $\bm{\eta}^E$ are defined as stated in \figurename{\ref{fig:roll_pitch_yaw}}.
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:pos}
	\bm{\xi} = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}
	\bm{x}^E & \bm{\eta}^E \\
	\end{array}\right]^T = \left[ \begin{array}{cccccc}
	x & y & z & \phi & \theta & \psi\\
	\end{array}\right] ^T
	\end{equation}  
	The generalized velocity $\bm{\nu}$ (\ref{eq:vel}) contains the linear and angular velocity, and it is expressed in the body frame.
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:vel}
	\bm{\nu} = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}
	\bm{v}^B & \bm{\omega}^B \\
	\end{array}\right]^T = \left[ \begin{array}{cccccc}
	u & v & w & p & q & r\\
	\end{array}\right] ^T 
	\end{equation}
	
	Three rotation matrixes around each of the $x, y, z$ axes can be defined according to (\ref{eq:rotx}, \ref{eq:roty}, \ref{eq:rotz}) respectively.
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:rotx}
	\bm{R}_x (\phi)=
	\left[ {\begin{array}{ccc}
		1 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & \cos(\phi) & -\sin(\phi) \\
		0 &  \sin(\phi) & \cos(\phi) \\ 
		\end{array} } \right]
	\end{equation}  
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:roty}
	\bm{R}_y (\theta)=
	\left[ {\begin{array}{ccc}
		\cos(\theta) & 0 & \sin(\theta) \\
		0 & 1 & 0 \\
		-\sin(\theta) &  0 & \cos(\theta) \\ 
		\end{array} } \right]
	\end{equation}  
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:rotz}
	\bm{R}_z (\psi)=
	\left[ {\begin{array}{ccc}
		\cos(\psi) & -\sin(\psi) & 0 \\
		\sin(\psi) & \cos(\psi) & 0 \\
		0 &  0 & 1 \\ 
		\end{array} } \right]
	\end{equation}  
	The complete rotation matrix $\bm{R}_\Theta$, that expresses the rotation from the body frame to the Earth frame, can be obtained by multiplying these three matrixes, as in (\ref{eq:rot}).
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:rot}
	\bm{R}_\Theta (\phi, \theta, \psi) = 	\bm{R}_x (\phi)  \bm{R}_y (\theta)  \bm{R}_z (\psi)
	\end{equation}  
	
	The transfer matrix $\bm{T}_\Theta$ that allows to change between the angular velocity in the body frame $\bm{\omega}^B$ and the Euler rates in the Earth frame $\bm{\dot \eta}^E$  can be determined and is as shown in (\ref{eq:transf}).
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:transf}
	\bm{T}_\Theta (\phi,\theta )= \left[ {\begin{array}{ccc}
		1 & \sin(\phi) \cdot \tan(\theta) & \cos(\phi) \cdot \tan (\theta) \\
		0 & \cos(\phi) & -\sin(\phi) \\
		0 &  \sin(\phi)/\cos(\theta) & \cos(\phi)/\cos(\theta)  \\ 
		\end{array} } \right]
	\end{equation}  
	
	A generalized matrix $\bm{J}_\Theta$ can be built joining the rotation and the transfer matrix (\ref{eq:rot}, \ref{eq:transf}), as shown in (\ref{eq:gen}).
	
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:gen}
	\bm{J}_\Theta (\phi,\theta, \psi)= \left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
		\bm{R}_\Theta &  \mathbf{0}_{3\times 3} \\
		\mathbf{0}_{3\times 3} & \bm{T}_\Theta \\
		\end{array} } \right]
	\end{equation}  
	Where the notation $\mathbf{0}_{3\times 3}$ means a matrix filled with zeros with a $3 \times 3$ dimension.
	
	In order to relate the derivate of the generalized position in the Earth frame with the generalized velocity on the body frame, the transfer matrix (\ref{eq:transf}) can be used, and that is the final model of the quadrotor's kinematics.
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:derivpos_earth_body}
	\bm{\dot \xi} %= \left[ {\begin{array}{c}
	%	\dot x\\
	%	\dot y\\
	%	\dot z\\
	%	\dot \phi\\
	%	\dot \theta\\
	%	\dot \psi\\
	%	\end{array} } \right]
	= \bm{J}_\Theta \ \bm{\nu}
	\end{equation}
	
	\subsection{Dynamics}
	The dynamic model for the UAV relates the acceleration of the vehicle with the forces and torques acting on the quadrotor. The Newton-Euler formulation allows to express the variables in the body frame, as in equations (\ref{eq:newton_euler_forces}) and (\ref{eq:newton_euler_torques}), as clearly stated by Bresciani in \cite{mod_control_bresciani}.
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:newton_euler_forces}
	\bm{F}^B = m ( \bm{\dot v}^B + \bm{\omega}^B \times \bm{v}^B)
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:newton_euler_torques}
	\bm{\tau}^B = \bm{I} \ \bm{\dot \omega}^B + \bm{\omega}^B \times (\bm{I} \ \bm{\omega}^B)
	\end{equation}
	
	\section{Sensors}
	The core of this project focuses on how to make aerial vehicles fly autonomously from an initial position to a goal. Therefore, apart from the main algorithm that will make this possible, it is really important that the vehicle can acquire precise information about its condition and its surroundings. Sensors do not only have to provide information about the state of the UAV as to close the loop for the controller, but also about the objects the vehicle may encounter throughput its path, as to make the navigation safe, and prevent and block possible crashes.\\

		\subsection{Inertial Measurement Unit}
		This module is in charge of measuring almost all the variables related to the movement of the vehicle. Usually inside this module  a 3-axis accelerometer, a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis magnetometer can be found.
