  abstract     = {This thesis work focused on the study of a quadrotor helicopter. The dynamic system modelling and the control algorithm evaluation were carried out. To test the results, a simulator and a real platform were developed. The Newton-Euler formalism was used to model the dynamic system. Particular attention was given to the group composed of the DC-motor, the gear box and the propeller which needed also the estimation of aerodynamic lift and torque to reach better accuracy. PID control algorithms were compared. The first stage tests were performed on a simulated model where it was easy to evaluate the performance with a mathematical approach. The second stage tests were carried out on the quadrotor platform to evaluate the behavior of the real system. A simulator based on Matlab-Simulink was developed. With this program it was possible to test the accuracy of the model and the robustness of the control algorithms. Furthermore a 3D graphic output and a joystick interface made easier the testability and the observability of the system. A quadrotor platform was developed. The electronics was composed of a Micro Control Unit (MCU) interfaced with several devices: the power supply, the receiving unit, the DC-motor power boards, the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), the SONAR and the IR modules. Thanks to these devices and the MCU software, both guided and autonomous flights were possible.},

	abstract = "In this work, a mathematical model of a quadrotor’s dynamics is derived, usingNewton’s and Euler’s laws. A linearized version of the model is obtained, andtherefore a linear controller, the Linear Quadratic Regulator, is derived. Afterthat, two feedback linearization control schemes are designed. The first one isthe dynamic inversion with zero dynamics stabilization, based on Static FeedbackLinearization obtaining a partial linearization of the mathematical model.The second one is the exact linearization and non-interacting control via dynamicfeedback, based on Dynamic Feedback Linearization obtaining a total linearizationof the mathematical model. Moreover, these nonlinear control strategiesare compared with the Linear Quadratic Regulator in terms of performances.Finally, the behavior of the quadrotor under the proposed control strategies isobserved in virtual reality by using the Simulink 3D Animation toolbox.",
